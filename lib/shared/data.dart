It&rsquo;s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to  malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone&rsquo;s security features and it could mean that the Virasat-E-Khalsa App won&rsquo;t work properly or at all.<br>You should be aware that there are certain things that Virasat-E-Khalsa will not take responsibility for. The App requires an active internet connection for certain functionalities. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider. Virasat-E-Khalsa cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don&rsquo;t have access to Wi-Fi/Internet.<br>If you&rsquo;re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still Apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third-party charges. In using the App, you&rsquo;re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you&rsquo;re using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer (if any of them exists) for using the App.<br>To ensure best possible use of the App, we strongly recommend to be up to date with the latest operating system and browser version.<br>Along the same lines, Virasat-E-Khalsa cannot take responsibility for the way you use the App. You also need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can&rsquo;t turn it on to travel updates and notifications, Virasat-E-Khalsa cannot accept responsibility if you are as a result not able to travel.<br>You should also remember that the App&rsquo;s passport scanner (when made available) function&rsquo;s purpose is to make things more convenient for you – it doesn&rsquo;t replace your travel documents, and you will still need to bring them to the airport in order to fly.<br>Lastly, with respect to our responsibility for your use of the App, it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so as to provide you with useful updates when there are likely or confirmed changes. So, it is not intended to wholly replace the need to stay informed of updates that are made on screens throughout the terminal or via airport loudspeaker announcements. Therefore, we cannot accept liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App rather than using all the resources in the airport to keep yourself updated as to the details of your flight.<br>By downloading the App from this site or clicking on the &quot;Accept&quot; button below you agree to the terms of the licence, stated above, which will bind you. Furthermore, this also includes your acceptance of our privacy policy as available on our website.<br>If you do not agree to the terms of this licence, we will not license the App to you and you must stop the downloading or streaming process (as Applicable) now.<br>EULA 1.1. 2022</p>';
