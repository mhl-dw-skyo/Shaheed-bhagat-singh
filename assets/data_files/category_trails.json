Most members of his family were nationalists. Arjan Singh, the grandfather of Bhagat Singh, was a landlord and follower of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who established the Arya Samaj, a social reform movement to remove inequities in society. A member of the Arya Samaj who \r\npromoted non-violent means, Arjan Singh played a significant role in diffusing the idea of Swaraj in Punjab. Bhagat Singh’s grandmother, Sardarni Jai Kaur, was also an ardent Arya Samaji who courageously supported Arjan Singh during India’s freedom struggle. Bhagat Singh often mentioned his grandmother in his writings as the source of his inspiration and dedication.\r\nBhagat Singh’s grandparents had three sons. Kishan Singh, Bhagat Singh’s father, was an active member of the Ghadar Party, who introduced to his son, the political ideology of socialism which found expression in his writings. Kishan Singh also instilled a passion for independence in Bhagat Singh. Bhagat Singh’s mother, Vidyawati Devi, was the source of his tenacity and determination. She did not let her \r\nson’s early demise dim the patriotism with which the Singh household countered colonisation. Her sacrifice and teachings made Bhagat Singh immortal in world history",

Its objective was to impart ideas of nationalism to the Indian diaspora of youth and immigrants. The purpose was crystal clear: to tell the world that the British were not benevolent, but pilots of despotic rule. The movement appealed for unity among the Indian people; to fight against the British rule. The Ghadar Party diffused revolutionary ideology through arms and ideas, with an uncompromising dream of a sovereign republican India. \r\nMembers of the Ghadar Party, including Sohan Singh Bhakna, Visakha Singh Dadeher, Jawala SinghThathia, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Lala Hardyal, Barakatullah Kahn & Tarak Nath Das strengthened their objectives with unwavering commitment. In 1914, Lala Hardayal, a revolutionary and profound scholar wrote: ‘The time for prayer and petition has gone, it is now time for the swords to speak.’ The Ghadarites are known for their struggle and sacrifices.",

However, passengers were denied entry as the Canadian Government, hostile to non-White immigration, had amended the Immigration Act (1910), Immigrants had to possess $200, eight times the amount mandated for the White Immigrants and had to show a continuous journey from their country of citizenship. The Canadian Government considered Indian immigrants as subjected of the British Empire rather than citizens.  \r\nIn a deadlock, legal proceedings against these discriminatory laws initiated by Indians in Vancouver continued for two months. The Canadian port authorities rationed supplies of food and water to the passengers. Subsequently, only 24 passengers were permitted into Canada. The rest returned to a colonised homeland. The Komagata Maru reached Calcutta (present Kolkata) on 27 September 1914. On 29 September 1914, the ship reached the Budge Ghat, 27 Kilometer from Calcutta. A scuffle broken out with 321 passangers on the ship. The police used gunfire & 22 passengers died. \r\nThe Komagata Maru incident, involving violation of human rights and arbitrary detention of passengers, created outrage among the Indians and intensified freedom struggle in India.\r\n",

Amid the chaos of deafening sound and thick smoke, the benches shattered into pieces as people rushed out. Except for some minor injuries, however, there were no casualties.

One of them had a fully loaded gun which he laid out on the table. Both of them shouted the slogan ‘Inquilab Zindabad!’. They did not try to escape.\r\n4. Once the smoke cleared, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt willingly courted arrest. Police Inspectors Terry and Johnson took the duo to the Chandni Chowk police station. Enroute, they distributed large red lettered leaflets with the words, ‘The Hindustan Socialist Republican Army' along with the slogan ‘It takes a loud voice to make the deaf hear.’ The incident drew international attention for India’s freedom struggle. \r\n5.

He ran away from home to Cownpore (present-day Kanpur) to avoid marriage.  \r\n1924: Returned home in six months to evade an arrest warrant issued for his involvement in organising a langar during the Jaito Morcha in Banga village. Bhagat Singh then worked as the head teacher  at the National School of Shadipur, Aligarh. In Kanpur, he became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), started by Sachindranath Sanyal. He also became a close associate of Chandra Shekhar Azad, the main organiser of the HRA. \r\n1926: Bhagat Singh founded the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, an organisation that aimed to encourage revolution against the British rule by provoking the working class. \r\n1927: Bhagat Singh was arrested on charges associated with the Kakori Case. He was accused of writing a politically charged article under the pseudonym ‘Vidrohi’. \r\n1928: Bhagat Singh primarily influenced the discussion for the change of name of the HRA to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) along with Sukhdev Thapar and Chandrashekhar Azad. He swore  to avenge Lala Lajpat Rai's death following a lathi charge by the police during a silent protest led by Chandrashekhar Azad against the Simon Commission. Bhagat Singh joined other revolutionaries to plot the assassination of James A. Scott, the Superintendent of Police who had ordered the lathi charge.  \r\n1929: Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt hurled two bombs in Delhi’s Central Legislative Assembly. The explosives were a protest against the Public Safety Bill and the Trade Disputes Bill—new laws designed to curb citizens' civil liberties.\r\n1930: The Hindustan Socialist Republican Association steadily declined since by 1930 the most of its leaders were either imprisoned or had been executed. \r\n1931: After the martyrdom of Chandrashekar Azad on February 27 1931, the HSRA lost most of its prominent leaders. \r\n1931: Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged to death on March 23 following the judgment in the Lahore Conspiracy Case.

It was presented to him by an employee off the Lahore Jail where he was lodged. A stained and crumpled old newspaper, announcing their hanging, has been preserved alongside remainscollected by Bhagat Singh's sister from the cremation site.The most poignant of them all however, is the pen that pronounced the death sentence on Punjab's greatest revolutionaries. A section of the display hall pays photographic tribute to the martyrs of the Kuka movement as well as those of the Gadar Party. The remaining walls are lined by pictures of the countless revolutionaries involved in the freedom movement. The grounds of the museum also house Bhagat Singh's father's granite-clad samadh; it is located to the left of the entrance gate.
