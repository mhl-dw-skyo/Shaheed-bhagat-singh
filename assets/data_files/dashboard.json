A copy ofthe judgement of the Lahore Conspiracy case sentencing him to death by hanging along with Kartar Singh Sarabha can be viewed here; as also an edition of the Bhagwad Gita with his name on it. It was presented to him by an employee off the Lahore Jail where he was lodged. A stained and crumpled old newspaper, announcing their hanging, has been preserved alongside remainscollected by Bhagat Singh's sister from the cremation site.The most poignant of them all however, is the pen that pronounced the death sentence on Punjab's greatest revolutionaries. A section of the display hall pays photographic tribute to the martyrs of the Kuka movement as well as those of the Gadar Party. The remaining walls are lined by pictures of the countless revolutionaries involved in the freedom movement. The grounds of the museum also house Bhagat Singh's father's granite-clad samadh; it is located to the left of the entrance gate. Less than a kilometer away in the village lies his ancestral house and can be accessed free of cost, too. Timings: 9amâ€“4.45 pm (Tues-Sun) / Closed: Monday& Public Holidays",
